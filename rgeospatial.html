<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.1</span> Goals</h2>
<p>Our goals for this chapter are just to see some of the ways we can wrangle and plot vector spatial data using R. This is by no means the only way and is not an exhaustive demonstration of the packages loaded, but it’ll get us started.</p>
<p>First, we need to define raster and vector spatial data.</p>
<p>Check out the images below for two examples of the same data represented as raster data or vector data.</p>
<p>Vector: Points, lines, polygons, boundaries are crisp regardless of scale Raster: Grid of same sized cells, vales in cells, cell size = resolution (smaller cells, higher resolution)</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/raster%20vector1.png" title="Raster vs. Vector 1" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Raster vs. Vector 1</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/raster%20vector2.png" title="Raster vs. Vector 2" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Raster vs. Vector 2</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Questions from these two images:</strong></p>
<p><em>What are the advantages/disadvantages of raster/vector for each?</em> Which is best to show on a map for each?  *For elevation, which would be better for calculating slope? </p>
<p>So, today we are sticking to vector data, but then we will be deal primarily with raster elevation data.</p>
</div>
<div id="intro-to-tmap" class="section level2" number="13.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.2</span> Intro to tmap</h2>
<p>We are going to mape maps mostly with tmap. But there are several other options.</p>
<p>Let’s look at how tmap works. It uses the same syntax as ggplot: the grammar of graphics.</p>
<p>First we want to set tmap to static map mode. This is what we would want if we were making maps for a manuscript or a paper. You can also make interactive maps with tmap, which we will show later.</p>
<p>Then we will have a look at the us_states data from the data package we loaded above.</p>
<p><em>What extra information does the data have beyond a regular R object?</em> Play around with it, can you reference columns in the table the same way you would with a regular object?</p>

<p>Let’s make a map showing the us_states data. Each state has coordinates to draw it in the dataset, and tmap knows how to deal with that. It uses the same format as ggplot, but instead of ggplot() you will use tm_shape(). Then the geoms are prefixed tm_, so we will use tm_fill to show a map of the US with states filled in with a color.</p>

<p>We can save these objects to view or edit later just like a ggplot object. We will save the above map as <em>usa</em>.</p>
<p>Then we can use several built in geometries in tmap to add a compass, scale, and title. Note the syntax for specifying the position of the objects. You could do this all in one statement too if you wanted.</p>

<p>Below is an example of how to edit the “symbology” of the map. In other words, we want to color each of the polygons depending on a variable. Here we make the states more blue if they have a higher population.</p>
<p>The syntax below is basically (pseudo code):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Represent us_states as shapes +<br />
color the shapes based on total_pop_10, use 10 colors, use the Blues palette<br />
add a legend in the bottom right, add some space for the title, define the title, position the title<br />
add a compass at the bottom left<br />
add a scale bar at the bottom left<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to filtering, we can use the data in the geospatial table to calculate additional parameters, just like with a normal object. Below we calculate growth by subtracting the 2010 population from the 2015 population, and percent growth but dividing 2015-2010 by population in 2010 and multiplying by 100.</p>

<p>We have been using us_states. There is another dataset called us_states_df that has even more data, but it is just a regular tibble, not a geospatial file.</p>
<p>We need to attach data from us_states_df to the us_states geospatial file based on state name. How in the world will we do that?</p>
<p>A JOIN!!</p>
<p>In us_states the state names are in a column called <em>NAME</em> and in us_states_df they are in a column called <em>state</em>. So when we do the join, we need to tell R that these columns are the same and we want to use them to match the values. We will do a left join to accomplish this.</p>

<p>You can also generate maps that you can interact with, as opposed to static maps, that we have been using before. If you are generating a map for an app or webpage, this may be a good choice. But for a pdf report, the static maps are more appropriate.</p>
<p>In tmap all you have to do is run tmap_mode(“view”) and it will create an interactive map with the exact same syntax! To switch back to a static map, run tmap_mode(“plot”)</p>
<p>Also in this chunk we see how to add a basemap to a tmap object.</p>
