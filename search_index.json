Basic ggplot syntax 2.3 Our first ggplot Let’s look at the Pine data, plotting streamflow (the cfs column) by the date (datetime column). We will show the time series as a line. ggplot(data = Pine, aes(x = datetime, y = cfs))+ geom_line() 2.4 Change point type Now let’s make the same plot but show the data as points, using the pch parameter in geom_point() we can change the point type to any of the following: pch options from R help file ggplot(data = Pine, aes(x = datetime, y = cfs))+ geom_point(pch = 8) 2.5 Set colors We can also “easily” change the color. Easily is in quotes because this often trips people up. If you put color = “blue” in the aesthetic function, think about what that is telling ggplot. It says “control the color using”blue\"\". That doesn’t make a whole lot of sense, so neither does the output… Try it. What happens is that if color = “blue” is in the aesthetic, ggplot creates a new column of data, basically, and fills it with “blue.” So it is like you had a column in your data filled with the value “blue.” So it uses that data, and sets the color equal to the first default color in the ggplot color palette, which is red. It kind of feels like R is trolling you… doesn’t it. Take the color = “blue” out of the aesthetic and you’re golden. ggplot(data = Pine, aes(datetime, y = cfs, color = &quot;blue&quot;))+ geom_point() ggplot(data = Pine, aes(x = datetime, y = cfs))+ geom_point(color = &quot;blue&quot;) 2.6 Controlling color with a third variable and other functions Let’s plot the data as a line again, but play with it a bit. First: make the line blue Second: change the theme Third: change the axis labels Fourth: color by discharge ggplot(data = Pine, aes(x = datetime, y = cfs, color = cfs))+ geom_line()+ ylab(&quot;Discharge (cfs)&quot;)+ xlab(element_blank())+ theme_classic() 2.7 Plotting multiple groups The SNP dataset has two different streams: Pine and NFDR We can look at the two of those a couple of different ways First, make two lines, colored by the stream by adding color = to your aesthetic. ggplot(data = SNP, aes(x = datetime,y = cfs, color = StationID)) + geom_line() 2.8 Facets We can also use facets. You must tell the facet_wrap what variable to use to make the separate panels (facet =). It’ll decide how to orient them or you can tell it how. We want them to be on top of each other so we are going to tell it we want 2 rows by setting nrow = 2. Note that we have to put the column used to make the facets in quotes after facets = ggplot(data = SNP, aes(x = datetime,y = cfs)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(facets = &quot;StationID&quot;, nrow = 2) 2.9 Two variable faceting You can also use facet_grid() to break your plots up into panels based on two variables. Below we will create a panel for each month in each watershed. Adding scales = “free” allows facet_grid to change the axes. By default, all axes will be the same. This is often what we want, so we can more easily compare magnitudes, but sometimes we are looking for patterns more, so we may want to let the axes have whatever range works for the individual plots. ggplot(data = SNP, aes(x = datetime,y = cfs)) + geom_line() + facet_grid(StationID ~ month, scales = &quot;free&quot;) 2.10 Boxplots We can look at these data in other ways as well. A very useful way to look at the variation of two groups is to use a boxplot. Because the data span several orders of magnitude, we will have to log the y axis to see the differences between the two streams. We do that by adding scale_y_log10() ggplot(data = SNP, aes(x = StationID, y = cfs)) + stat_boxplot()+ scale_y_log10() 2.11 More about color, size, etc Let’s play around a bit with controlling color, point size, etc with other data. We can control the size of points by putting size = in the aes() and color by putting color = If you use a point type that has a background, like #21, you can also set the background color using bg = If points are too close together to see them all you can use a hollow point type or set the alpha lower so the points are transparent (alpha = ) ggplot(RBI, aes(RBI, DRAIN_SQKM, size = T_AVG_SITE, bg = STATE))+ geom_point(pch = 21, alpha = 0.3) 2.12 Multiple geoms Finally: You can add multiple geoms to the same plot. Examples of when you might want to do this are when you are showing a line fit and want to show the points as well, or maybe showing a boxplot and want to show the data behind it. You simply add additional geom_… lines to add additional geoms. ggplot(RBI, aes(RBI, DRAIN_SQKM, color = AGGECOREGION))+ stat_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, linetype = 2)+ geom_point() ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; "],["Programming.html", "Chapter 3 R Tidyverse Programming Basics 3.1 Introduction 3.2 You can use R as a calculator 3.3 You can create new objects using &lt;- 3.4 Using functions 3.5 Read in some data. 3.6 Wait, hold up.

So now let’s review or introduce you to some basics. Even if you have worked in R before, it is good to be remind of/practice with this stuff, so stay tuned in! This exercise covers most of the same principles as two chapters in R for Data Science Workflow: basics (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html) Data transformation (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) 3.2 You can use R as a calculator If you just type numbers and operators in, R will spit out the results 1 + 2 ## [1] 3 3.3 You can create new objects using &lt;- Yea yea, = does the same thing. But use &lt;-. We will call &lt;- assignment or assignment operator. When we are coding in R we use &lt;- to assign values to objects and = to set values for parameters in functions. Using &lt;- helps us differentiate between the two. Norms for formatting are important because they help us understand what code is doing, especially when stuff gets complex. Oh, one more thing: Surround operators with spaces. Don’t code like a gorilla. x &lt;- 1 looks better than x&lt;-1 and if you disagree you are wrong. You can assign single numbers or entire chunks of data using &lt;- So if you had an object called my_data and wanted to copy it into my_new_data you could do: my_new_data &lt;- my_data You can then recall/print the values in an object by just typing the name by itself. In the code chunk below, assign a 3 to the object “y” and then print it out. y &lt;- 3 y ## [1] 3 If you want to assign multiple values, you have to put them in the function c() c means combine. R doesn’t know what to do if you just give it a bunch of values with space or commas, but if you put them as arguments in the combine function, it’ll make them into a vector. Any time you need to use several values, even passing as an argument to a function, you have to put them in c() or it won’t work. a &lt;- c(1,2,3,4) a ## [1] 1 2 3 4 When you are creating objects, try to give them meaningful names so you can remember what they are. You can’t have spaces or operators that mean something else as part of a name. And remember, everything is case sensitive. Assign the value 5.4 to water_pH and then try to recall it by typing “water_ph” water_pH &lt;- 5.4 #water_ph You can also set objects equal to strings, or values that have letters in them. To do this you just have to put the value in quotes, otherwise R will think it is an object name and tell you it doesn’t exist. Try: name &lt;- “JP” and then name &lt;- JP What happens if you forget the ending parenthesis? Try: name &lt;- \"JP R can be cryptic with it’s error messages or other responses, but once you get used to them, you know exactly what is wrong when they pop up. name &lt;- &quot;JP&quot; #name &lt;- JP 3.4 Using functions As an example, let’s try the seq() function, which creates a sequence of numbers. seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 #or seq(1, 10, 1) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 #or seq(1, 10) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 #what does this do seq(10,1) ## [1] 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 3.5 Read in some data. For the following demonstration we will use the RBI data from a sample of USGS gages we used last class. First we will load the tidyverse library, everything we have done so far is in base R. Important: read_csv() is the tidyverse csv reading function, the base R function is read.csv(). read.csv() will not read your data in as a tibble, which is the format used by tidyverse functions. library(tidyverse) rbi &lt;- read_csv(&quot;Flashy_Dat_Subset.csv&quot;) ## ## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## cols( ## .default = col_double(), ## STANAME = col_character(), ## STATE = col_character(), ## CLASS = col_character(), ## AGGECOREGION = col_character() ## ) ## ℹ Use `spec()` for the full column specifications. 3.6 Wait, hold up. What is a tibble? Good question. It’s a fancy way to store data that works well with tidyverse functions. Let’s look at the rbi tibble. head(rbi) ## # A tibble: 6 x 26 ## site_no RBI RBIrank STANAME DRAIN_SQKM HUC02 LAT_GAGE LNG_GAGE STATE CLASS ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1013500 0.0584 35 Fish R… 2253. 1 47.2 -68.6 ME Ref ## 2 1021480 0.208 300 Old St… 76.7 1 44.9 -67.7 ME Ref ## 3 1022500 0.198 286 Narrag… 574. 1 44.6 -67.9 ME Ref ## 4 1029200 0.132 183 Seboei… 445. 1 46.1 -68.6 ME Ref ## 5 1030500 0.114 147 Mattaw… 3676. 1 45.5 -68.3 ME Ref ## 6 1031300 0.297 489 Piscat… 304. 1 45.3 -69.6 ME Ref ## # … with 16 more variables: AGGECOREGION &lt;chr&gt;, PPTAVG_BASIN &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # PPTAVG_SITE &lt;dbl&gt;, T_AVG_BASIN &lt;dbl&gt;, T_AVG_SITE &lt;dbl&gt;, T_MAX_BASIN &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # T_MAXSTD_BASIN &lt;dbl&gt;, T_MAX_SITE &lt;dbl&gt;, T_MIN_BASIN &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # T_MINSTD_BASIN &lt;dbl&gt;, T_MIN_SITE &lt;dbl&gt;, PET &lt;dbl&gt;, SNOW_PCT_PRECIP &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # PRECIP_SEAS_IND &lt;dbl&gt;, FLOWYRS_1990_2009 &lt;dbl&gt;, wy00_09 &lt;dbl&gt; Now read in the same data with read.csv() which will NOT read the data as a tibble.

You can do a lot more with select, especially when you need to select a bunch of columns but don’t want to type them all out. But we don’t need to cover all that today. For a taste though, if you want to select a group of columns you can specify the first and last with a colon in between (first:last) and it’ll return all of them.

Common uses are to create a column of data in different units, or to calculate something based on two columns. You can also use it to just update a column, by naming the new column the same as the original one (but be careful because you’ll lose the original one!). I commonly use this when I am changing the datatype of a column, say from a character to a factor or a string to a date. Create a new column in rbi called T_RANGE by subtracting T_MIN_SITE from T_MAX_SITE mutate(rbi, T_RANGE = T_MAX_SITE - T_MIN_SITE) ## # A tibble: 49 x 27 ## site_no RBI RBIrank STANAME DRAIN_SQKM HUC02 LAT_GAGE LNG_GAGE STATE CLASS ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1013500 0.0584 35 Fish R… 2253. 1 47.2 -68.6 ME Ref ## 2 1021480 0.208 300 Old St… 76.7 1 44.9 -67.7 ME Ref ## 3 1022500 0.198 286 Narrag… 574. 1 44.6 -67.9 ME Ref ## 4 1029200 0.132 183 Seboei… 445. 1 46.1 -68.6 ME Ref ## 5 1030500 0.114 147 Mattaw… 3676. 1 45.5 -68.3 ME Ref ## 6 1031300 0.297 489 Piscat… 304. 1 45.3 -69.6 ME Ref ## 7 1031500 0.320 545 Piscat… 769 1 45.2 -69.3 ME Ref ## 8 1037380 0.318 537 Ducktr… 39 1 44.3 -69.1 ME Ref ## 9 1044550 0.242 360 Spence… 500. 1 45.3 -70.2 ME Ref ## 10 1047000 0.344 608 Carrab… 909. 1 44.9 -70.0 ME Ref ## # … with 39 more rows, and 17 more variables: AGGECOREGION &lt;chr&gt;, ## # PPTAVG_BASIN &lt;dbl&gt;, PPTAVG_SITE &lt;dbl&gt;, T_AVG_BASIN &lt;dbl&gt;, T_AVG_SITE &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # T_MAX_BASIN &lt;dbl&gt;, T_MAXSTD_BASIN &lt;dbl&gt;, T_MAX_SITE &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # T_MIN_BASIN &lt;dbl&gt;, T_MINSTD_BASIN &lt;dbl&gt;, T_MIN_SITE &lt;dbl&gt;, PET &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # SNOW_PCT_PRECIP &lt;dbl&gt;, PRECIP_SEAS_IND &lt;dbl&gt;, FLOWYRS_1990_2009 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # wy00_09 &lt;dbl&gt;, T_RANGE &lt;dbl&gt; When downloading data from the USGS through R, you have to enter the gage ID as a character, even though they are all made up of numbers.

Not only is this more efficient, but structuring operations with pipes is also more intuitive than nesting functions within functions (the other way you can do multiple operations). 3.13.1 Let’s say we want to tell R to make a PB&amp;J sandwich by using the pbbread(), jbread(), and joinslices() functions and the data “ingredients.” If we do this saving each step if would look like this: sando &lt;- pbbread(ingredients) sando &lt;- jbread(sando) sando &lt;- joinslices(sando) 3.13.2 If we nest the functions together we get this joinslice(jbread(pbbread(ingredients))) Efficient… but tough to read/interpret 3.13.3 Using the pipe it would look like this ingredients %&gt;% pbbread() %&gt;% jbread() %&gt;% joinslices() Much easier to follow! 3.13.4 When you use the pipe, it basically takes whatever came out of the first function and puts it into the data argument for the next one so rbi %&gt;% group_by(STATE) is the same as group_by(rbi, STATE) Take the groupby and summarize code from above and perform the operation using the pipe rbi %&gt;% group_by(STATE) %&gt;% summarize(meanrbi = mean(RBI), maxrbi = max(RBI), minrbi = min(RBI)) ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument) ## # A tibble: 7 x 4 ## STATE meanrbi maxrbi minrbi ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 CT 0.366 0.430 0.295 ## 2 MA 0.367 0.487 0.213 ## 3 ME 0.269 0.492 0.0584 ## 4 NH 0.336 0.368 0.265 ## 5 NY 0.342 0.856 0.0464 ## 6 RI 0.201 0.230 0.172 ## 7 VT 0.299 0.365 0.231 3.14 Save your results to a new tibble We have just been writing everything to the screen so we can see what we are doing… In order to save anything we do with these functions to work with it later, we just have to use the assignment operator (&lt;-) to store the data. One kind of awesome thing about the assignment operator is that it works both ways… x &lt;- 3 and 3 -&gt; x do the same thing (WHAT?!) So you can do the assignment at the beginning of the end of your dplyr workings, whatever you like best. Use the assignment operator to save the summary table you just made. stateRBIs &lt;- rbi %&gt;% group_by(STATE) %&gt;% summarize(meanrbi = mean(RBI), maxrbi = max(RBI), minrbi = min(RBI)) ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument) # Notice when you do this it doesn&#39;t output the result... # You can see what you did by clickon in stateRBIs in your environment panel # or just type stateRBIs stateRBIs ## # A tibble: 7 x 4 ## STATE meanrbi maxrbi minrbi ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 CT 0.366 0.430 0.295 ## 2 MA 0.367 0.487 0.213 ## 3 ME 0.269 0.492 0.0584 ## 4 NH 0.336 0.368 0.265 ## 5 NY 0.342 0.856 0.0464 ## 6 RI 0.201 0.230 0.172 ## 7 VT 0.299 0.365 0.231 3.15 What about NAs? We will talk more about this when we discuss stats, but some operations will fail if there are NA’s in the data. If appropriate, you can tell functions like mean() to ignore NAs. You can also use drop_na() if you’re working with a tibble. But be aware if you use that and save the result, drop_na() gets rid of the whole row, not just the NA. Because what would you replace it with…. an NA? x &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,NA) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) ## [1] 2.5 3.16 What are some things you think I’ll ask you to do for the activity next class? "],["introactivity.html", "Chapter 4 Intro Skills Activity 4.1 Problem 1 4.2 Problem 2 4.3 Problem 3 4.4 Problem 4 4.5 Problem 5 4.6 Problem 6", " Chapter 4 Intro Skills Activity 4.1 Problem 1 Load the tidyverse and lubridate libraries. Read in the PINE_NFDR_Jan-Mar_2010 csv using read_csv() Make a plot with the date on the x axis, discharge on the y axis. Show the discharge of the two watersheds as a line, coloring by watershed (StationID) 4.2 Problem 2 Make a boxplot to compare the discharge of Pine to NFDR for February 2010. Hint: use the pipe operator and the filter() function. Hint2: when you filter dates, you have to let R know you’re giving it a date. You can do this by using the mdy() function from lubridate. 4.3 Problem 3 Read in the Flashy Dat Subset file. For only sites in ME, NH, and VT: Plot PET (Potential Evapotranspiration) on the X axis and RBI (flashiness index) on the Y axis. Color the points based on what state they are in. Use the classic ggplot theme. 4.4 Problem 4 We want to look at the amount of snow for each site in the flashy dataset. Problem is, we are only given the average amount of total precip (PPTAVG_BASIN) and the percentage of snow (SNOW_PCT_PRECIP). Create a new column in the dataset called SNOW_AVG_BASIN and make it equal to the average total precip times the percentage of snow (careful with the percentage number). Make a barplot showing the amount of snow for each site in Maine. Put station name on the x axis and snow amount on the y. You have to add something to geom_bar() to use it for a 2 variable plot… check out the ggplot cheatsheet or do a quick internet search. The x axis of the resulting plot looks terrible! Can you figure out how to rotate the X axis labels so we can read them? 4.5 Problem 5 Create a new tibble that contains the min, max, and mean PET for each state. Sort the tibble by mean PET from high to low. Give your columns meaningful names within the summarize function or using rename(). Be sure your code outputs the tibble. 4.6 Problem 6 Take the tibble from problem 5. Create a new column that is the Range of the PET (max PET - min PET). Then get rid of the max PET and min PET columns so the tibble just has columns for State, mean PET, and PET range. Be sure your code outputs the tibble.

Pick better value with `binwidth`. 5.3 What is the difference between a sample and a population. Simply put: a population is the thing you are trying to measure. A sample is the data you measure in an effort to measure the population. A sample is a subset of a population. Let’s write some code for an example: We will create a POPULATION that is a large set of numbers. Think of this is as the concentration of Calcium in every bit of water in a lake. Then we will create a SAMPLE by randomly grabbing values from the POPULATION. This simulates us going around in a boat and taking grab samples in an effort to figure out the concentration of calcium in the lake. We can then run this code a bunch of times, you’ll get a different sample each time. You can also take a smaller or larger number of samples by changing “size” in the sample() function. How does your sample distribution look similar or different from the population? Why does the sample change every time you run it? What happens as you increase or decrease the number of samples? What happens if you set the number of samples to the size of the population? all_the_water &lt;- rnorm(10000, mean = 6) %&gt;% as_tibble() sample_of_water &lt;- sample(all_the_water$value, size = 100, replace = FALSE) %&gt;% as_tibble() population_hist &lt;- all_the_water %&gt;% ggplot(aes(value))+ geom_histogram()+ ggtitle(&quot;Population: All the water in the lake&quot;) sample_hist &lt;- sample_of_water %&gt;% ggplot(aes(value))+ geom_histogram()+ ggtitle(&quot;Your sample of the lake&quot;) population_hist + sample_hist ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. 5.4 Measuring our sample distribution: central tendency. When we take a sample of a population, there are a few things we will want to measure about the distribution of values: where is the middle, how variable is it, and is it skewed to one side or another? The first of these, “where is the middle?” is addressed with measures of central tendency. We will discuss three possible ways to measure this. The mean, median, and weighted mean. To explain the importance of choosing between the mean and median, we will first import some discharge data. Read in the PINE discharge data. pineQ &lt;- read_csv(&quot;PINE_Jan-Mar_2010.csv&quot;) ## ## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## cols( ## StationID = col_character(), ## cfs = col_double(), ## surrogate = col_character(), ## datetime = col_datetime(format = &quot;&quot;), ## year = col_double(), ## quarter = col_double(), ## month = col_double(), ## day = col_double() ## ) To find the mean (average), you just sum up all the values in your sample and divide by the number of values. To find the median, you put the values IN ORDER, and choose the middle value. The middle value is the one where there are the same number of values higher than that value as there are values lower than it. Because it uses the order of the values rather than just the values themselves, the median is resistant to skewed distributions. This means it is less effected by very large or very small values compared to most values in the sample data. Let’s look at our normal distribution from earlier (ExNorm) compared to the Pine watershed discharge (pineQ) Note that distributions like pineQ, that are positively skewed, are very common in environmental data. #Calculate mean and median for cfs in pineQ and values in ExNorm pineMean &lt;- mean(pineQ$cfs) pineMedian &lt;- median(pineQ$cfs) xmean &lt;- mean(ExNorm$value) xmedian &lt;- median(ExNorm$value) #plot mean and median on the ExNorm distribution Ex &lt;- ExNorm %&gt;% ggplot(aes(value)) + geom_histogram()+ geom_vline(xintercept = xmean, color = &quot;red&quot;)+ geom_vline(xintercept = xmedian, color = &quot;blue&quot;) #plot mean and median on the pineQ discharge histogram PineP &lt;- pineQ %&gt;% ggplot(aes(cfs)) + geom_histogram()+ geom_vline(xintercept = pineMean, color = &quot;red&quot;)+ geom_vline(xintercept = pineMedian, color = &quot;blue&quot;) Ex / PineP ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. 5.4.1 So what’s a weighted average? When you compute a standard mean or median, you are giving equal weight to each measurement. Adding up all the values in a sample and dividing by the number of samples is the same as multiplying each value by 1/# of samples. For instance if you had ten samples, to calculate the mean you would add them up and divide by 10. This is the same as multiplying each value by 1/10 and then adding them up. Each value is equally weighted at 1/10. There are certain situations in which this is not the ideal way to calculate an average. A common one in hydrology is that you have samples that are supposed to represent different portions of an area. One sample may be taken to measure a forest type that takes up 100 ha of a watershed while another sample represents a forest type that only takes up 4 ha. You may not want to simply average those values! Another example is precipitation gages. In the image below, you see there are 5 rain gages. To get a precipitation number for the watershed, we could just average them, or we could assume they represent an area of the watershed and then weight their values by the area they represent. One method of designating the areas is by using Theissen polygons (the middle watershed). Another method of weighting is isohyetal contours, but we won’t worry about that for now! In the weighted situation, we find the average by multiplying each precipitation values by the proportion of the watershed it represents, shown by the Thiessen polygons, and then add them all together. Let’s do an example. source: https://edx.hydrolearn.org/assets/courseware/v1/e5dc65098f1e8c5faacae0e171e28ccf/asset-v1:HydroLearn+HydroLearn401+2019_S2+type@asset+block/l2_image004.png The precip values for the watershed above are 4.5, 5.5, 5.8, 4.7, and 3.0 We will assume the proportions of the watershed that each gauge represents are 0.20, 0.15, 0.40, 0.15, 0.10, respectively (or 20%, 15%, 40%, 15%, 10%) Write some code to compute the regular mean precip from the values, and then the weighted mean. precip &lt;- c(4.5, 5.5, 5.8, 4.7, 3.0) weights &lt;- c(0.2, 0.15, 0.4, 0.15, 0.1) mean(precip) ## [1] 4.7 sum(precip * weights) ## [1] 5.05 5.5 Measures of variability Measures of variability allow us to measure the width of our sample data histogram or pdf. If all the values in our sample are close together, we would have small measures of variability, and a pointy pdf/histogram. If they vary more, we would have larger measures of variability and a broad pdf/histogram. We will explore four measures of variability: 5.5.0.1 Variance: Sum of the squared difference of each value from the mean divided by the number of samples minus 1. var() 5.5.0.2 Standard deviation: The square root of the variance sd() **Both variance and standard deviation are sensitive to outliers. 5.5.0.3 CV: Coefficient of Variation is simply the standard deviation divided by the mean of the data. Because you divide by the mean, CV is dimensionless. This allows you to use it to compare the variation in samples with very different magnitudes. 5.5.0.4 IQR: Interquartile Range is resistant to outliers because it works like a median. It measures the range of the middle 50% of the data in your distribution. So the IQR is the difference between the value between the 75th and 25th percentiles of your data, where the 75th percentile means 75% of the data is BELOW that value and the 25th percentile means 25% is below that value. Using the same vocabulary, the median is the same as the 50th percentile of the data. If you ask R for the QUANTILES of your sample data, it will give you the values at which 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the data are below. These are the 1,2,3,4, and 5th quantiles. Therefore, the IQR is the difference between the 4th and 2nd quantile. Okay, code time. First, let’s explore how changing the variability of a distribution changes the shape of it’s distribution. Create a plot a random normal distribution using rnorm() and set sd to different numbers. Make the mean of the distribution 0, the sample size 300, and the standard deviation 1 to start. Then increase the standard deviation incrementally to 10 and see what happens. Make the limits of the x axis on the plot -30 to 30. rnorm(300, mean = 0, sd = 1) %&gt;% as_tibble %&gt;% ggplot(aes(value))+ stat_density()+ xlim(c(-30,30)) Now let’s calculate the standard deviation, variance, coefficient of variation, and IQR of the Pine discharge data. #standard deviation sd(pineQ$cfs) ## [1] 84.47625 #variance var(pineQ$cfs) ## [1] 7136.237 #coefficient of variation sd(pineQ$cfs)/mean(pineQ$cfs) ## [1] 2.800221 #IQR using the IQR funciton IQR(pineQ$cfs) ## [1] 8.1325 #IQR using the quantile function quants &lt;- quantile(pineQ$cfs) quants[4] - quants[2] ## 75% ## 8.1325 5.5.0.5 What about how lopsided the distribution is? There are several ways to measure this as well, but we are just going to look at one: The Quartile skew. The quartile skew is the difference between the upper quartiles (50th-75th) and the lower quartiles (25th-50th) divided by the IQR (75th-25th). Quartile skew from USGS Stats Book linked above Let’s look at the quartile skew of the two distributions we’ve been measuring. Calculate it for the pineQ discharge data and the random normal distribution we generated. Which one is more skewed? quantsP &lt;- quantile(pineQ$cfs) ((quantsP[3]-quantsP[2]) - (quantsP[2] - quantsP[1])) / quantsP[3] - quantsP[1] ## 50% ## -4.837233 quantsX &lt;- quantile(ExNorm$value) ((quantsX[3]-quantsX[2]) - (quantsX[2] - quantsX[1])) / quantsX[3] - quantsX[1] ## 50% ## -2.718904 5.6 What is a normal distribution and how can we determine if we have one? The distribution we generated with rnorm() is a normal distribution. The distribution of pineQ discharge is not normal. Now that we’ve looked at different ways to characterize distributions, we have the vocabulary to describe why. Normal distributions: mean = median, half values to the right, half to the left symmetric (not skewed) Many statistical tests require that the distribution of the data you put into them is normally distributed. BE CAREFUL! There are also tests that use ranked data. Similar to how the median is resistant to outliers, these rank-based tests are resistant to non-normal data. Two popular ones are Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank-sum. But how far off can you be before you don’t consider a distribution normal? Seems like a judgement call! R to the rescue! There is a built in test for normality called shapiro.test(), which performs the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality. The hypothesis this test tests is “The distribution is normal.” So if this function returns a p-value less than 0.05, you reject that hypothesis and your function is NOT normal. You can also make a quantile-quantile plot. A straight line on this plot indicates a normal distribution, a non-straight line indicates it is not normal. shapiro.test(pineQ$cfs) ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: pineQ$cfs ## W = 0.27155, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 qqnorm(pineQ$cfs) "],["intro-stats-activity.html", "Chapter 6 Intro Stats Activity 6.1 1.

Think about the dataRetrieval as a way to interact with same public data you can access through waterdata.usgs.gov but without having to click on buttons and search around. It makes getting data or doing analyses with USGS data much more reproducible and fast! To explore a few of the capabilities (NOT ALL!!) we will start with the USGS gage on the New River at Radford. The gage number is 03171000. The documentation for the package is extremely helpful: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataRetrieval/vignettes/dataRetrieval.html I always have to look up how to do things because the package is very specialized! This is the case with most website APIs, in my experience. It’s a good argument for getting good at navigating package documentation! Basically you just look through and try to piece together the recipe for what you want to do using the examples they give in the document. First, let’s get information about the site using the readNWISsite() and whatNWISdata() functions. Try each out and see what they tell you.

This is a common attribute of databases: you use a common identifier but then have the full information in a lookup file. In this case, the look-up information telling us what the parameter codes mean is in “parameterCdFile” which loads with the dataRetrieval package. So, you could look at that and see what the parameters mean. OR We could have R do it and add a column that tells us what the parameters mean. Enter JOINS! Joins allow us to combine the data from two different data sets that have a column in common. At its most basic, a join looks for a matching row with the same key in both datasets (for example, a USGS gage number) and then combines the rows. So now you have all the data from both sets, matched on the key. But you have to make some decisions: what if a key value exists in one set but not the other? Do you just drop that observation? Do you add an NA? Let’s look at the different options. The following images from from the R for Data Science book linked above (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html) Take for example the two data sets, x and y. The colored numbers are the key values and the x and y values are the data. source: https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/108c0749d084c03103f8e1e8276c20e06357b124/5f113/diagrams/join-setup.png Note the 1 &amp; 2 keys match up, but 3 and 4 only exist in one data set or the other. The first way to deal with this is an inner join: inner_join() In an inner join, you only keep records that match. So the rows for 3 and 4 will be dropped because there is no corresponding data in the other set. See below: source: https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3abea0b730526c3f053a3838953c35a0ccbe8980/7f29b/diagrams/join-inner.png) But what if you don’t want to lose the values in one or the other or both?! For instance, let’s say you have a bunch of discharge data for a stream, and then chemistry grab samples. You want to join the chemistry to the discharge based on the dates and times they were taken. But when you do this, you don’t want to delete all the discharge data where there is no chemistry! We need another option. Enter OUTER JOINS source: https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9c12ca9e12ed26a7c5d2aa08e36d2ac4fb593f1e/79980/diagrams/join-outer.png The image above shows the three outer joins: LEFT JOIN, left_join(): Preserves all values from the LEFT data set, and pastes on the matching ones from the right. This creates NAs where there is a value on the left but not the right. (this is what you’d want to do in the discharge - chemistry example above) RIGHT JOIN, right_join(): Preserves all values from the RIGHT data set, and pastes on the matching ones from the left. This creates NAs where there is a values on the right but not the left. FULL JOIN, full_join(): KEEP EVERYTHING! The hoarder of the joins. No matching record on the left? create an NA on the right! No matching value on the right? Create an NA on the left! NAs for everyone! When you do this in R, you use the functions identified in the descriptions with the following syntax: 7.3.0.1 if the column is named the same in both data sets xxx_join(left_tibble, right_tibble, by = “key_column”) 7.3.0.2 if the column is named differently in both data sets xxx_join(left_tibble, right_tibble, by = c(“left_key” = “right_key”) Note in both of the above, when you specify which column to use as “by” you have to put it in quotes. So in the chunk below let’s get add information about the parameters in dataAvailable by joining it with the key file: parameterCdFile. The column with the parameter codes is called parm_cd in dataAvailable and parameter_cd in parameterCdFile dataAvailable &lt;- left_join(dataAvailable, parameterCdFile, by = c(&quot;parm_cd&quot; = &quot;parameter_cd&quot;)) dataAvailable ## agency_cd site_no station_nm site_tp_cd dec_lat_va dec_long_va ## 1 USGS 03171000 NEW RIVER AT RADFORD, VA ST 37.14179 -80.56922 ## 2 USGS 03171000 NEW RIVER AT RADFORD, VA ST 37.14179 -80.56922 ## 3 USGS 03171000 NEW RIVER AT RADFORD, VA ST 37.14179 -80.56922 ## coord_acy_cd dec_coord_datum_cd alt_va alt_acy_va alt_datum_cd huc_cd ## 1 U NAD83 1711.99 0.13 NAVD88 05050001 ## 2 U NAD83 1711.99 0.13 NAVD88 05050001 ## 3 U NAD83 1711.99 0.13 NAVD88 05050001 ## data_type_cd parm_cd stat_cd ts_id loc_web_ds medium_grp_cd parm_grp_cd ## 1 dv 00010 00003 241564 NA wat &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 dv 00060 00003 145684 NA wat &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 dv 00095 00003 145685 NA wat &lt;NA&gt; ## srs_id access_cd begin_date end_date count_nu parameter_group_nm ## 1 1645597 0 2006-12-20 2009-03-18 704 Physical ## 2 1645423 0 1907-10-01 2021-02-18 32648 Physical ## 3 1646694 0 2006-12-20 2008-09-29 534 Physical ## parameter_nm ## 1 Temperature, water, degrees Celsius ## 2 Discharge, cubic feet per second ## 3 Specific conductance, water, unfiltered, microsiemens per centimeter at 25 degrees Celsius ## casrn srsname parameter_units ## 1 &lt;NA&gt; Temperature, water deg C ## 2 &lt;NA&gt; Stream flow, mean. daily ft3/s ## 3 &lt;NA&gt; Specific conductance uS/cm @25C #that made a lot of columns, let&#39;s clean it up dataAvailClean &lt;- dataAvailable %&gt;% select(site_no, station_nm, parm_cd, srsname, parameter_units, begin_date, end_date) dataAvailClean ## site_no station_nm parm_cd srsname ## 1 03171000 NEW RIVER AT RADFORD, VA 00010 Temperature, water ## 2 03171000 NEW RIVER AT RADFORD, VA 00060 Stream flow, mean. daily ## 3 03171000 NEW RIVER AT RADFORD, VA 00095 Specific conductance ## parameter_units begin_date end_date ## 1 deg C 2006-12-20 2009-03-18 ## 2 ft3/s 1907-10-01 2021-02-18 ## 3 uS/cm @25C 2006-12-20 2008-09-29 7.4 So how do you find the site ids for downloading data? You can find sites via map and just enter the id like we did in the chunks above: https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/index.html Below we will look at two other ways to get sites: using a bounding box of a geographic region, or search terms like State and drainage area #find sites in a bounding box #coords of bottom left, top right swva &lt;- c(-81.36, 36.72, -80.27, 37.32) #get sites in this bounding box that have daily water temperature and discharge swva_sites &lt;- whatNWISsites(bBox = swva, parameterCd = c(&quot;00060&quot;, &quot;00010&quot;), hasDataTypeCd = &quot;dv&quot;) swva_sites ## agency_cd site_no station_nm ## 1 USGS 03473500 M F HOLSTON RIVER AT GROSECLOSE, VA ## 2 USGS 03175140 WEST FORK COVE CREEK NEAR BLUEFIELD, VA ## 3 USGS 03177710 BLUESTONE RIVER AT FALLS MILLS, VA ## 4 USGS 03177700 BLUESTONE RIVER AT BLUEFIELD, VA ## 5 USGS 03166000 CRIPPLE CREEK NEAR IVANHOE, VA ## 6 USGS 03164500 NEW RIVER NEAR GRAYSON, VA ## 7 USGS 03165500 NEW RIVER AT IVANHOE, VA ## 8 USGS 03166880 WEST SP AT NAT FISH HAT NEAR GRAHAMS FORGE, VA ## 9 USGS 03166800 GLADE CREEK AT GRAHAMS FORGE, VA ## 10 USGS 03166900 BOILING SP AT NAT FISH HAT NR GRAHAMS FORGE, VA ## 11 USGS 03167000 REED CREEK AT GRAHAMS FORGE, VA ## 12 USGS 03175500 WOLF CREEK NEAR NARROWS, VA ## 13 USGS 03168500 PEAK CREEK AT PULASKI, VA ## 14 USGS 03168000 NEW RIVER AT ALLISONIA, VA ## 15 USGS 03167500 BIG REED ISLAND CREEK NEAR ALLISONIA, VA ## 16 USGS 03172500 WALKER CREEK AT STAFFORDSVILLE, VA ## 17 USGS 03173000 WALKER CREEK AT BANE, VA ## 18 USGS 03171500 NEW RIVER AT EGGLESTON, VA ## 19 USGS 03171000 NEW RIVER AT RADFORD, VA ## 20 USGS 03170000 LITTLE RIVER AT GRAYSONTOWN, VA ## 21 USGS 03169500 LITTLE RIVER NEAR COPPER VALLEY, VA ## site_tp_cd dec_lat_va dec_long_va colocated queryTime ## 1 ST 36.88873 -81.34733 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 2 ST 37.18428 -81.32982 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 3 ST 37.27151 -81.30482 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 4 ST 37.25595 -81.28177 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 5 ST 36.85984 -80.98036 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 6 ST 36.75985 -80.95619 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 7 ST 36.83485 -80.95258 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 8 SP 36.93429 -80.90313 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 9 ST 36.93095 -80.90036 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 10 SP 36.93068 -80.89619 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 11 ST 36.93901 -80.88730 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 12 ST 37.30568 -80.84980 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 13 ST 37.04734 -80.77618 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 14 ST 36.93762 -80.74563 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 15 ST 36.88901 -80.72757 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 16 ST 37.24179 -80.71090 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 17 ST 37.26818 -80.70951 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 18 ST 37.28957 -80.61673 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 19 ST 37.14179 -80.56922 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 20 ST 37.03763 -80.55672 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 ## 21 ST 36.99652 -80.52144 FALSE 2021-02-19 11:16:35 #find sites with other criteria, VA, less than 20 sqmi, other criteria can be used.. #check out the CRAN documentation smallVA &lt;- readNWISdata(service = &quot;dv&quot;, stateCd = &quot;VA&quot;, parameterCd = &quot;00060&quot;, drainAreaMax = &quot;20&quot;, statCd = &quot;00003&quot;) 7.5 OK let’s download some data! We are going to use readNWISdv(), which downloads daily values. We will tell it which sites to download, which parameters to download, and then what time period to download. siteNumber gets the sites we want to download, USGS site numbers, as a character. We will use the swva_sites data we generated (yep, you can download multiple sites at once!) startDate and endDate get the…. start and end dates. IMPORTANT: These must be in YYY-MM-DD format, but you don’t have to tell R they are dates before you give them to the function, it’ll do that for you. parameterCd get the parameters you want to download. We want water temperature and discharge, which are “00060” and “00010,” respectively. Once we have the data, the column names correspond to the keys that identify them, for example, discharge will be 00060 something something. Fortunately the dataRetrieval package also provides “renameNWISColumns()” which translates these into words, making them more easily understood by humans. We can pipe the results of our download to that function after we get the data to make the column names easier to understand. start &lt;- &quot;2006-10-01&quot; end &lt;- &quot;2008-09-30&quot; params &lt;- c(&quot;00010&quot;, &quot;00060&quot;) swva_dat &lt;- readNWISdv(siteNumber = swva_sites$site_no, parameterCd = params, startDate = start, endDate = end) %&gt;% renameNWISColumns() Let’s plot the water temperature data as a line and control the color of the lines with the different sites. What could be better about this plot? swva_dat %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = Wtemp, color = site_no)) + geom_line() ## Warning: Removed 2218 row(s) containing missing values (geom_path). We can add site names with….More joins! Our swva_sites data has the names of the sites in human-friendly language. The column in the downloaded data and in the swva_sites data is called “site_no” so we just give that to the “by” argument. Perform a left join to add the names of the sites to the data. Then use select to remove some of the unnecessary columns. Then make the plot and then snazz it up with labels and a non-junky theme. swva_dat_clean &lt;- left_join(swva_dat, swva_sites, by = &quot;site_no&quot;) %&gt;% select(station_nm, site_no, Date, Flow, Wtemp, dec_lat_va, dec_long_va) swva_dat_clean %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = Wtemp, color = station_nm)) + geom_line()+ ylab(&quot;Water temperature (deg C)&quot;)+ xlab(element_blank())+ labs(color = &quot;Gage Site&quot;)+ theme_classic() ## Warning: Removed 2218 row(s) containing missing values (geom_path). 7.6 Pivoting: wide and long data Okay, so with the data above: what would you do if you wanted to subtract the discharge or temperature of one gage from another on the same river: to compute rate of change between the two sites, for instance. You could split them into two objects, then join based on date? Or…now hear me out… you could PIVOT them. A two-dimensional object can be either long or wide. Each has it’s advantages. 7.6.1 LONG Each observation has it’s own row. In the first image below, the table on the left is long because each measure of “cases” has it’s own row. It’s year and country are identified by a second column, and the values in that column repeat a lot. (Look at country and year in the table on the left) 7.6.2 WIDE Observations of different things have their own columns. In the second image below, notice in the right hand table there is a “cases” and “population” column rather than an identifier in a separate column like in the table on the left. 7.6.3 Why? Long and wide data are more efficient for different things. Think about plotting a data set with 10 stream gages. If they are in a long format, you can just add color = Gage to your ggplot aes(). If they are in a wide format, meaning each gage has it’s own column, you’d have to write a new geom for EACH gage, because they’re all in separate columns. Now imagine you want to do some math to create new data: let’s say cases divided by population in the second image below…. How would you even do that using the data on the left? With the wide data on the right it is simply mutate(casesPERpop = cases / population). Finally, which table is easier to read in TABLE format (not a plot) in each of the two images below? Wide data is much more fitting for tables. source: https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3aea19108d39606bbe49981acda07696c0c7fcd8/2de65/images/tidy-9.png source: https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8350f0dda414629b9d6c354f87acf5c5f722be43/bcb84/images/tidy-8.png dplyr, part of the tidyverse, has functions to convert data between wide and long data. I have to look up the syntax every single time I use them. But they are VERY useful. Back to our original question: I want to subtract the flow at Ivanhoe from the flow at Radford on the new river to see how much flow increases between the two sites through time. To do this I am going to use pivot_wider() to give Ivanhoe and Radford discharges their own column. First, we will use select to trim the data to just what we need, then call pivot_wider telling it which data to use for the new column names (names_from = station_nm) and what values we want to pivot into the data under those columns (values_from = Flow). Then, subtract the two and make a plot! #Pivot so we can compute diffs between one river and others swva_wide &lt;- swva_dat_clean %&gt;% select(station_nm, Flow, Date) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = station_nm, values_from = Flow) swva_wide &lt;- swva_wide %&gt;% mutate(Radford_Ivanhoe = `NEW RIVER AT RADFORD, VA` - `NEW RIVER AT IVANHOE, VA`) ggplot(swva_wide, aes(x = Date, y = Radford_Ivanhoe))+ geom_line()+ ggtitle(&quot;Change in flow from Ivanhoe to Radford&quot;)+ theme_classic() To further illustrate how to move between long and wide data and when to use them, let’s grab some water quality data. This process will also review some of the other concepts from this topic. In the chunk below we will look to see what sites have data for nitrate and chloride in our swva bounding box from above. We will them filter them to just stream sites (leave out groundwater and springs). And finally we will download the nitrate and chloride data for those sites. #Nitrate as nitrate and chloride params &lt;- c(&quot;00940&quot;, &quot;71851&quot;) #what sites in our bounding box have cloride and nitrate swva_chem_sites &lt;- whatNWISsites(bBox = swva, parameterCd = params) #filte to just stream water swva_chem_sites &lt;- filter(swva_chem_sites, site_tp_cd == &quot;ST&quot;) wqdat &lt;- readNWISqw(siteNumber = swva_chem_sites$site_no, parameterCd = params) comment(wqdat) ## [1] &quot;#&quot; ## [2] &quot;# File created on 2021-02-19 11:16:40 EST&quot; ## [3] &quot;#&quot; ## [4] &quot;# U.S. Geological Survey&quot; ## [5] &quot;# &quot; ## [6] &quot;# This file contains selected water-quality data for stations in the National Water &quot; ## [7] &quot;# Information System water-quality database.

Join the parameter names from parameterCdFile and then join the site names from swva_chem_site. Then select just the columns we want, and finally filter the remaining data to just look at sites from the New River. To illustrate the functionality of the data in this format, plot Chloride for each site, and then plot Chloride AND Nitrate, using the parameter name in facet_wrap. wqdat_clean &lt;- wqdat %&gt;% left_join(parameterCdFile, by = c(&quot;parm_cd&quot; = &quot;parameter_cd&quot;)) %&gt;% left_join(swva_chem_sites, by = &quot;site_no&quot;) %&gt;% select(station_nm, sample_dt, sample_tm, result_va, srsname, parameter_units) %&gt;% filter(str_detect(station_nm, &quot;NEW RIVER&quot;)) wqdat_clean %&gt;% filter(srsname == &quot;Chloride&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = sample_dt, y = result_va, color = station_nm)) + geom_point()+ ylab(&quot;Chloride (mg/L)&quot;)+ xlab(element_blank())+ labs(color = &quot;Site&quot;)+ theme_classic() wqdat_clean %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = sample_dt, y = result_va, color = station_nm)) + geom_point()+ facet_wrap(facets = &quot;srsname&quot;, nrow = 2)+ ylab(&quot;Concentration (mg/L)&quot;)+ xlab(element_blank())+ labs(color = &quot;Site&quot;)+ theme_classic() Now let’s say we want to calculate something with chloride and nitrate. We need to make the data wide so we have a nitrate column and a chloride column. Do that below. What goes into values_from? what goes into names_from? Next, plot Chloride + Nitrate.

There are many distributions but a common one used is the Gumbel extreme value distribution. x is observed discharge data, u and x are parameters that shape the distribution. We can calculate u and x in order to create a distribution that best fits our data with the following equations. Notice x bar is mean and sx2 is variance. We will need to find sx, which is the square root of the variance, also known as the standard deviation. Gumbel parameters xbar &lt;- mean(peakflows$peak_va) sx &lt;- sd(peakflows$peak_va) alpha &lt;- (sqrt(6)*sx) / pi u &lt;- xbar - (0.5772 * alpha) Now that we have the parameters that best represent our data as a Gumbel Distribution, we can use the formula to create the theoretical values for the return interval according to that distribution. First calculate p theoretical with the equation above.

We can create a function that returns the return period for a flood of any magnitude for the gage we are investigating. Creating functions is a great way to streamline your workflow. You can write a function that performs an operation you need to perform a bunch of times, then just use the function rather than re-writing the code.
